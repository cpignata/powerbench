1.  Introduction

   Energy efficiency is becoming increasingly important in the operation
   of network infrastructure.  Network devices are typically always on,
   but in some cases, they run at very low average utilization rates.
   Both network utilization and energy consumption of these devices can
   be improved, and that starts with a normalized characterization
   [RFC7460].  The benchmarking methodology defined here will help

   operators to get a more accurate idea of the power drawn by their
   network and will also help vendors to test the energy efficiency of
   their devices [RFC6988].

   There is no standard mechanism to benchmark the power utilization of
   networking devices like routers or switches.
   [I-D.manral-bmwg-power-usage] started to analyze the issue.  This
   document defines the mechanism to correctly characterize and
   benchmark the energy consumption of networking devices to better
   estimate and compare their power usage.

1.1.  Aim and Scope

   Benchmarking can be understood to serve two related but different
   objectives:

      Assessing ''which system performs best'' over a set of well-
      defined scenarios.

      Measuring the contribution of sub-systems to the overall system's
      performance (also known as ''micro-benchmark'').

   Achieving either objectives requires a well-defined set of principles
   prescribing what must be measured, how, and how to report the
   results.  Providing those principles is the objective of this draft.
   These are simply called "the benchmark" in the rest of this draft.

   The benchmark aims to compare the energy efficiency for individual
   devices (routers and switches belonging to similar device classes).
   In addition, it aims to showcase the effectiveness of various energy
   optimization techniques for a given device and load type, with the
   objective of fostering improvements in the energy efficiency of
   future generations of devices.

1.2.  Replicability and Comparability

   Replicability is defined as achieving the same results with newly
   collected data.  Formally, it is a pre-requisite for benchmarking.
   Benchmark results are meant to be compared, and this comparison is
   not sound is the individual results are not replicable.

   As discussed later in this draft, replicability in power measurements
   is complex as power is affected by a wide range of parameters, some
   of which are hard to control e.g., the room temperature.  Scrit

   Striving for "perfect" replicability would lead to prescribe
   extremely precisely all the power-impacting factors in the test
   setup.  We argue that this is unrealistic and counter-productive.  An



Pignataro, et al.         Expires 30 July 2025                  [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                 PowerBench                   January 2025


   overly presciptive benchmark becomes more complicated to perform.
   Furthermore, results would then be comparable only accross benchmark
   results obtained under the exact same test conditions, which becomes
   increasingly less likely as we prescribe more and more.

   Instead, the benchmark described in this draft proposes to report on
   a number of power-impacting factors, but does not enforce specific
   values or settings for those.  The aim is to make the benchmark
   easier to perform.  The comparison between benchmark results may be
   somewhat less accurate or fair than with a more prescriptive
   benchmark, but the hope is to have many more comparison points
   available, which would ultimately provide a more robust image of the
   devices power demands and their evolution over time.

   In short: this draft argues it is better to have many benchmark
   results with a higher uncertainty than a few very precise but hardly
   comparable ones.

1.3.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Terminology

   TODO (Romain): I am not convinced we want to keep those weighted
   metrics at all.  Not deleting for now.  Creating a new "total power"
   section instead.

2.1.  Total Weighted Capacity of the interfaces

   The total weighted capacity of the interfaces (T) is the weighted sum
   of all interface throughputs.

   Definition:

      T = B1*T1 +...+ Bi*Ti +...+ Bm*Tm

   Discussion:

      Ti is the total capacity of the interfaces for a fixed
      configuration model and traffic load (the sum of the interface
      bandwidths)





Pignataro, et al.         Expires 30 July 2025                  [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                 PowerBench                   January 2025


      Bi is the weighted multiplier for different traffic levels (note
      that B1+...+Bj+...+Bm = 1, weight multipliers may be specified for
      router, switch differently, 3 typical weighted multipliers are
      0.1,0.8,0.1)

      m is the number of traffic load levels (if it is considered 100%,
      30%, 0%; m = 3) Note that traffic load levels may be specified
      differently for router and switch, e.g., traffic level 100%,10%,0%
      for access router, traffic level 100%,30%,0% for core router and
      data center switch.

   Measurement units:

      Gbps.

   Issues

      The traffic loads and the weighted multipliers need to be clearly
      established a priori.

      It is unclear if the definition of the Ti's is/should be linked to
      the traffic load levels.  For a given port configuration (which
      may result in 50% of the total capacity a device can provide), one
      may be interested in traffic load of e.g., 5% or 10% or the total
      capacity (not only 50%).

      [ETSI-ES-203-136],[ITUT-L.1310] ,[ATIS-0600015.03.2013].

2.2.  Total Weighted Power

   The total weighted power (P) is the weighted sum of all power
   calculated for different traffic loads.

   Definition:

      P = B1*P1 +...+ Bi*Pi +...+ Bm*Pm

   Discussion:

      Pi is the Power of the equipment in each traffic load level (e.g.
      100%, 30%, 0%)

      Bi is the weighted multiplier for different traffic levels (note
      that B1+...+Bj+...+Bm = 1)





Pignataro, et al.         Expires 30 July 2025                  [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                 PowerBench                   January 2025


      m is the number of traffic load levels (if it is considered 100%,
      30%, 0%; m = 3)

   Measurement units:

      Watt.

   Issues:

      The traffic loads and the weighted multipliers need to be clearly
      established a priori.

      Importantly, the traffic must be forwarded of the correct port!
      It would be easy to cut power down by dropping all traffic, and,
      naturally, we do not want that.  A tolerance on packet loss and/or
      forwarding error must be specified somehow.  That tolerance could
      be zero for some benchmark problems (e.g., Non packet loss (NDR)
      estimation), and non-zero for others.  Tolerating some errors may
      be interesting to navigate the design space of energy saving
      techniques, such as approximate computing/routing.  According to
      measurement procedure in section 6.5 of [ATIS-0600015.03.2013],
      the Equipment Unit Test (EUT) should be able to return to full NDR
      load.  Failure to do so disqualifies the test results.

   See Also:

      [ETSI-ES-203-136],[ITUT-L.1310] ,[ATIS-0600015.03.2013].

2.3.  Total Power

   The total power (P) is the power of the entire equipment, measured as
   the sum the power drawn by all of the equipment's power supply units.

   Definition:

      P = P1 +...+ Pi +...+ Pm

   Discussion:

      Pi is the power that is drawn by one power supply unit of the
      equipment

   Measurement units:

      Watt.

   Issues:




Pignataro, et al.         Expires 30 July 2025                  [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                 PowerBench                   January 2025


      The total power depends on many different factors, including the
      running configuration, the number and type of transceiver
      connected, the forward traffic volume and pattern, the version of
      the operating system, the room temperature and humidity/other
      environmental dimensions, the aging of parts, etc.  This metric
      does not allow to compare two equipements against each over, but
      it may be enough to assess the effect of a change on the same
      equipment; e.g., for optimizing the power draw by changing the
      running configuration.

      Importantly, the traffic must be forwarded of the correct port!
      It would be easy to cut power down by dropping all traffic, and we
      of course do not want that.  A tolerance on packet loss and/or
      forwarding error must be specified somehow.  That tolerance could
      be zero for some benchmark problems, and non-zero for others.
      Tolerating some errors may be interesting to navigate the design
      space of energy saving techniques, such as approximate computing/
      routing.

2.4.  Energy Efficiency Ratio

   Energy Efficiency Ratio (EER) is defined as the throughput forwarded
   by 1 watt and it is introduced in [ETSI-ES-203-136].  A higher EER
   corresponds to a better the energy efficiency.

   Definition:

      EER = T/P

   Discussion:

      T is the total weighted sum of all interface throughputs

      P is the weighted power for different traffic loads

   Measurement units:

      Gbps/Watt.

   Issues:

      The traffic loads and the weighted multipliers need to be clearly
      established a priori.

   See Also:

3.  Energy Consumption Benchmarking

   The maximum power drawn by a device does not accurately reflect the
   power under a normal workload.  Indeed, the energy consumption of a
   networking device depends on its configuration, connected
   transceivers, and traffic load.  Relying merely on the maximum rated
   power can overestimate the total energy of the networking devices.

   A network device consists of many components, each of which draws
   power (for example, it is possible to mention the power draw of the
   CPU, data forwarding ASIC, memory, fan, etc.).  Therefore, it is
   important to formulate a consistent benchmarking method for network
   devices and consider the workload variation and test conditions.

   Enforcing controlled conditions on test conditions (e.g.,
   Temperature) is important for test procedure to make sure test
   conditions repeatable [RFC6985].  The measurement condition reported
   in [ATIS-0600015.2009] and [ITUT-L.1310] should be applied, e.g., the
   power measurements shall be performed in a laboratory environment
   under specific range of temperature, humidity and atmosphere
   pressure.

4.  Test Methodology

4.1.  Test Setup

   The test setup in general is compliant with [RFC2544].  The Device
   Under Test (DUT) is connected to a Tester and a Power Meter.  The
   Power Meter allows to measure the energy consumption of the device
   and can be used to measure power under various configurations and
   conditions.  Tests SHOULD (MUST?) be done by running one or several
   of the predefined traffic traces, which are crafted to test different
   power hungry tasks related to packet processing.  The Tester is also
   a traffic generator that enables changing traffic conditions.  It is
   OPTIONAL to choose a non-equal proportion for upstream and downstream
   traffic.

                            Figure 1: Test Setup

   It is worth mentioning that the DUT also dissipates significant heat.
   That means that part of the power is used for actual work while the
   rest is dissipated as heat.  This heating can lead to more power
   drawn by fans/ compressor for cooling the devices.  The benchmarking
   methodology does not measure the power drawn by external cooling
   infrastructure.  The Power Meter only measures the internal energy
   consumption of the device.

4.2.  Traffic and Device Characterization

   The traffic load supported by a device affects its energy
   consumption.  Therefore, the benchmark MUST include different traffic
   loads.

   The traffic load must specify packet sizes, packet rates, and inter-
   packet delays, as all may affect the energy consumption of network
   devices.  To enable replicable and comparable results, the benchmark
   specifies a set of traffic traces that MUST be used.  Those traces
   are described below and made available "ready to use".

   TODO: Describe the benchmark traffic traces here.

   There are different interface types on a network device and the power
   usage also depends on the kind of connector/transceiver used.  The
   interface type used needs to be specified as well.

Internet-Draft                 PowerBench                   January 2025


5.  Reporting Format

   The benchmark focuses on data that is either controllable (e.g., the
   number of active ports) or that can be externally measured (e.g., the
   total power).  Factors that are not measurable externally (e.g., CPU
   load, PSU efficiency) are intentionally left out.

   Network Device Hardware and Software versions:
      For the benchmarking tests, it must be specified.

   Number and type of line cards:
      For each test the total number of line cards and their types can
      be varied and must be specified.

   Number of enabled ports:
      For each test the number of enabled and disabled ports must be
      specified.

   Number of active ports:
      For each test the number of active and inactive ports must be
      specified.

   Port settings and interface types:
      For each test the port configuration and settings need to be
      specified.

   Port Utilization:
      For each test the port utilization of each port must be specified.
      The actual traffic load can use the information defined in
      [RFC2544].

   Traffic trace:
      For each test, the traffic trace used (amongst those prescribed by
      the benchmark) must be specified.

   Power measurement:
      For each test it must be specified.  All power measurements are
      done in Watts.

6.  Benchmarking Tests

6.1.  Throughput

   Objective:

      To determine the DUT throughput according to [RFC2544].

   Procedure:



Pignataro, et al.         Expires 30 July 2025                 [Page 10]

Internet-Draft                 PowerBench                   January 2025


      The test is done using a multi-port setup as specified in
      Section 16 and Section 26.1 of [RFC2544].

   Reporting format:

      The results of the throughput SHOULD be reported according to
      Section 5.

6.2.  Base Power

   Objective:

      To determine the base power drawn by the network device in its
      factory settings.

   Procedure:

      The measurement is done with the device in its factory settings,
      after it finished booting, and witout any transceiver plugged in.

   Reporting format:

      The results of the power measurement SHOULD be reported according
      to Section 5.

   Note:

      This measurement is useful to assess the energy efficiency of
      default settings.

6.3.  Idle Power

   Objective:

      To determine the power drawn by the network device in normal
      operation but without forwarding traffic.

   Procedure:

      The measurement is done with the device fully configured to
      forward traffic but without any traffic actually present.  All
      interfaces MUST be up.

   Reporting format:

      The results of the power measurement SHOULD be reported according
      to Section 5.

   Note:

      This measurement is useful to assess the energy used to activate
      the internal components used by the device to forward traffic.  It
      also captures the efficiency of the device at activating some
      "low-power mode" when there is no traffic to forward.

6.4.  Idle+ Power

   TODO: Find a better name for this.

   Objective:

      To determine the power drawn by the network device in normal
      operation with very small but non-zero traffic to forward.

   Procedure:

      The measurement is done with the device fully configured and the
      "minimum" traffic trace (TODO: this would refer to the benchmark
      traces listed above)/

   Reporting format:

      The results of the power measurement SHOULD be reported according
      to Section 5.

   Note:

      The "minimum" traffic trace creates a bidirectional flow of 1 pps
      on all active interfaces.  By comparison with the "Idle Power"
      measurement, this measurement captures the power cost of taking
      the device out of its "low-power mode."

6.5.  Energy Consumption with Traffic Load

   Objective:

      To determine the power drawn by a device.  The dynamic power,
      which is added to the idle+ power, should be proportional to its
      traffic load.

   Procedure:

      A specific number of packets at a specific rate is sent to
      specific ports/linecards of the DUT.  All DUT ports must operate
      under a specific traffic load, which is a percentage of the
      maximum throughput.

   Reporting format:

      The results of the power measurement SHOULD be reported according
      to Section 5.

6.6.  Energy Efficiency Ratio

   Objective:

      To determine the energy efficiency of the DUT.

   Procedure:

      Collect the data for all the traffic loads and apply the formula
      of Section 2.  For example, with all DUT ports operating stably
      under a percentage of the maximum throughput (e.g. 100%, 30%, 0%),
      record the average input power and calculate the total weighted
      power P and then the EER .

   Reporting format:

      The results of the energy efficiency ratio SHOULD be reported
      according to Section 5.

7.  Security Considerations

   The benchmarking characterization described in this document is
   constrained to a controlled environment (as a laboratory) and
   includes controlled stimuli.  The network under benchmarking MUST NOT
   be connected to production networks.

   Beyond these, there are no specific security considerations within
   the scope of this document.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
