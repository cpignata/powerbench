1.  Introduction

   Energy efficiency is becoming increasingly important in the operation
   of network infrastructure.  Network devices are typically always on,
   but in some cases, they run at very low average utilization rates.
   Both network utilization and energy consumption of these devices can
   be improved, and that starts with a normalized characterization
   [RFC7460].  The benchmarking methodology defined here will help
   operators to get a more accurate idea of the power drawn by their
   network and will also help vendors to test the energy efficiency of
   their devices [RFC6988].

   There is no standard mechanism to benchmark the power utilization of
   networking devices like routers or switches.
   [I-D.manral-bmwg-power-usage] started to analyze the issue.  This
   document defines the mechanism to correctly characterize and
   benchmark the energy consumption of networking devices to better
   estimate and compare their power usage.

1.1.  Aim and Scope

   Benchmarking can be understood to serve two related but different
   objectives:

      Assessing ''which system performs best'' over a set of well-
      defined scenarios.

      Measuring the contribution of sub-systems to the overall system's
      performance (also known as ''micro-benchmark'').

   The benchmarking methodology outlined in this draft focuses on the
   first objective.  Specifically, it aims to compare the energy
   efficiency for individual devices (routers and switches belonging to
   similar device classes).  The benchmark aims to showcase the
   effectiveness of various energy optimization techniques for a given
   device and load type, with the objective of fostering improvements in
   the energy efficiency of future generations of devices.

1.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Terminology

2.1.  Total Weighted Capacity of the interfaces

   The total weighted capacity of the interfaces (T) is the weighted sum
   of all interface throughputs.

   Definition:

      T = B1*T1 +...+ Bi*Ti +...+ Bm*Tm

   Discussion:





Pignataro, et al.       Expires 1 September 2024                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                 PowerBench                  February 2024


      Ti is the total capacity of the interfaces for a fixed
      configuration model and traffic load (the sum of the interface
      bandwidths)

      Bi is the weighted multiplier for different traffic levels (note
      that B1+...+Bj+...+Bm = 1, weight multipliers may be specified for
      router, switch differently, 3 typical weighted multipliers are
      0.1,0.8,0.1)

      m is the number of traffic load levels (if it is considered 100%,
      30%, 0%; m = 3) Note that traffic load levels may be specified
      differently for router and switch, e.g., traffic level 100%,10%,0%
      for access router, traffic level 100%,30%,0% for core router and
      data center switch.

   Measurement units:

      Gbps.

   Issues

      The traffic loads and the weighted multipliers need to be clearly
      established a priori.

      It is unclear if the definition of the Ti's is/should be linked to
      the traffic load levels.  For a given port configuration (which
      may result in 50% of the total capacity a device can provide), one
      may be interested in traffic load of e.g., 5% or 10% or the total
      capacity (not only 50%).

      [ETSI-ES-203-136],[ITUT-L.1310] ,[ATIS-0600015.03.2013].

2.2.  Total Weighted Power

   The total weighted power (P) is the weighted sum of all power
   calculated for different traffic loads.

   Definition:

      P = B1*P1 +...+ Bi*Pi +...+ Bm*Pm

   Discussion:

      Pi is the Power of the equipment in each traffic load level (e.g.
      100%, 30%, 0%)

Internet-Draft                 PowerBench                  February 2024


      Bi is the weighted multiplier for different traffic levels (note
      that B1+...+Bj+...+Bm = 1)

      m is the number of traffic load levels (if it is considered 100%,
      30%, 0%; m = 3)

   Measurement units:

      Watt.

   Issues:

      The traffic loads and the weighted multipliers need to be clearly
      established a priori.

      Importantly, the traffic must be forwarded of the correct port!
      It would be easy to cut power down by dropping all traffic, and we
      of course do not want that.  A tolerance on packet loss and/or
      forwarding error must be specified somehow.  That tolerance could
      be zero for some benchmark problems (e.g., Non packet loss (NDR)
      estimation), and non-zero for others.  Tolerating some errors may
      be interesting to navigate the design space of energy saving
      techniques, such as approximate computing/routing.  According to
      measurement procedure in section 6.5 of [ATIS-0600015.03.2013],
      the Equipment Unit Test (EUT) should be able to return to full NDR
      load.  Failure to do so disqualifies the test results.

   See Also:

      [ETSI-ES-203-136],[ITUT-L.1310] ,[ATIS-0600015.03.2013].

2.3.  Energy Efficiency Ratio

   Energy Efficiency Ratio (EER) is defined as the throughput forwarded
   by 1 watt and it is introduced in [ETSI-ES-203-136].  A higher EER
   corresponds to a better the energy efficiency.

   Definition:

      EER = T/P

   Discussion:

      T is the total weighted sum of all interface throughputs

      P is the weighted power for different traffic loads

   Measurement units:

      Gbps/Watt.

   Issues:

      The traffic loads and the weighted multipliers need to be clearly
      established a priori.

      [ETSI-ES-203-136],[ITUT-L.1310] ,[ATIS-0600015.03.2013].

3.  Energy Consumption Benchmarking

   The maximum power drawn by a device does not accurately reflect the
   power under a normal workload.  Indeed, the energy consumption of a
   networking device depends on its configuration, connected
   transceivers, and traffic load.  Relying merely on the maximum rated
   power can overestimate the total energy of the networking devices.

   A network device consists of many components, each of which draws
   power (for example, it is possible to mention the power consumption
   of the CPU, data forwarding ASIC, memory, fan, etc.).  Therefore, it
   is important to formulate a consistent benchmarking method for
   network devices and consider the workload variation and test
   conditions.

   Enforcing controlled conditions on test conditions (e.g.,
   Temperature) is important for test procedure to make sure test
   conditions repeatable [RFC6985].  The measurement condition reported
   in [ATIS-0600015.2009] and [ITUT-L.1310] should be applied, e.g., the
   power measurements shall be performed in a laboratory environment
   under specific range of temperature, humidity and atmosphere
   pressure.

4.  Test Methodology

4.1.  Test Setup

   The test setup in general is compliant with [RFC2544].  The Device
   Under Test (DUT) is connected to a Tester and a Power Meter.  The
   Power Meter allows to measure the energy consumption of the device
   and can be used to measure power under various configurations and
   conditions.  Tests SHOULD be done with bidirectional traffic that
   better reflects the real environment.  The Tester is also a traffic
   generator that enables changing traffic conditions.  It is OPTIONAL
   to choose a non-equal proportion for upstream and downstream traffic.

                       | +----->|        |-------+ |

                               +----------+

                            Figure 1: Test Setup

   It is worth mentioning that the DUT also dissipates significant heat.
   That means that part of the power is used for actual work while the
   rest is dissipated as heat.  This heating can lead to more power
   drawn by fans/ compressor for cooling the devices.  The benchmarking
   methodology does not measure the power drawn by external cooling
   infrastructure.  The Power Meter only measures the internal energy
   consumption of the device.

4.2.  Traffic and Device Characterization

   The traffic load supported by a device affects its energy
   consumption.  Therefore, the benchmark MUST include different traffic
   loads.

   There are different interface types on a network device and the power
   usage also depends on the kind of connector/transceiver used.  The
   interface type used needs to be specified as well.

   In addition, it is necessary to indicate the number of ports used per
   linecard as well as the aggregate bandwidth that each linecard can
   accommodate.

   The traffic load must specify traffic type, packet size mixtures,
   percentage of overall traffic for each traffic type (See Annex D of
   [ATIS-0600015.2009] for more details), as all may affect the energy
   consumption of network devices.

5.  Reporting Format

   Network Device Hardware and Software versions:
      For the benchmarking tests, it must be specified.

   Number and type of line cards:
      For each test the total number of line cards and their types can
      be varied and must be specified.

   Number of enabled ports:
      For each test the number of enabled and disabled ports must be
      specified.

   Number of active ports:
      For each test the number of active and inactive ports must be
      specified.

   Port settings and interface types:
      For each test the port configuration and settings need to be
      specified.

   Port Utilization:
      For each test the port utilization of each port must be specified.
      The actual traffic load can use the information defined in
      [RFC2544].

   Traffic attributes:
      For each test they must be specified (e.g., packet size, packet
      rate, etc.)

   CPU load:
      For each test it must be specified.

   Power measurement:

6.  Benchmarking Tests

6.1.  Throughput

   Objective:

      To determine the DUT throughput according to [RFC2544].

   Procedure:





Pignataro, et al.       Expires 1 September 2024                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft                 PowerBench                  February 2024


      The test is done using a multi-port setup as specified in
      Section 16 and Section 26.1 of [RFC2544].

   Reporting format:

      The results of the throughput SHOULD be reported according to
      Section 5.

6.2.  Base Power

   Objective:

      To determine the base power drawn by the network device, which
      typically consists of processors, fans, memory, etc.

   Procedure:

      The measurement is done without activating the traffic generator.
      In this case, the traffic load level percentage is 0.

   Reporting format:

      The results of the power measurement SHOULD be reported according
      to Section 5.

   Note:

      This measurement is useful since it permits to calculate the
      additional energy consumption that will result when the traffic
      load changes.

6.3.  Energy Consumption with Traffic Load

   Objective:

      To determine the power drawn by a device.  The dynamic power,
      which is added to the base power, should be proportional to its
      traffic load.

   Procedure:

      A specific number of packets at a specific rate is sent to
      specific ports/linecards of the DUT.  All DUT ports must operate
      under a specific traffic load, which is a percentage of the
      maximum throughput.

   Reporting format:

Internet-Draft                 PowerBench                  February 2024


      The results of the power measurement SHOULD be reported according
      to Section 5.

6.4.  Energy Efficiency Ratio

   Objective:

      To determine the energy efficiency of the DUT.

   Procedure:

      Collect the data for all the traffic loads and apply the formula
      of Section 2.  For example, with all DUT ports operating stably
      under a percentage of the maximum throughput (e.g. 100%, 30%, 0%),
      record the average input power and calculate the total weighted
      power P and then the EER .

   Reporting format:

      The results of the energy efficiency ratio SHOULD be reported
      according to Section 5.

7.  Security Considerations

   The benchmarking characterization described in this document is
   constrained to a controlled environment (as a laboratory) and
   includes controlled stimuli.  The network under benchmarking MUST NOT
   be connected to production networks.

   Beyond these, there are no specific security considerations within
   the scope of this document.
