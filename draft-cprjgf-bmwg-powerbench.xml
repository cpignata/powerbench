    <abstract>

   <t>This document defines a standard mechanism to measure, report, and
   compare power usage of different networking devices and under different
   network configurations and conditions.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
	
   <t>Energy efficiency is becoming increasingly important in the operation
   of network infrastructure. Network devices are typically always on, but
   in some cases, they run at very low average utilization rates. Both network
   utilization and energy consumption of these devices can be improved, 
   and that starts with a normalized characterization <xref target="RFC7460" />.

   The benchmarking methodology defined here will help operators to get
   a more accurate idea of the power drawn by their network and 
   will also help vendors to test the energy efficiency of their devices
   <xref target="RFC6988"/>.</t>

   <t>There is no standard mechanism to benchmark the power utilization 
   of networking devices like routers or switches. 
   <xref target="I-D.manral-bmwg-power-usage" /> started to analyze the issue.
   This document defines the mechanism to correctly characterize and benchmark 
   the energy consumption of networking devices to better 
   estimate and compare their power usage.</t>

   <!-- Romain: Well, not really, if we put the focus on "Assessing "who performs best" over 
   a set of well-defined scenario" as discussed. 
   I'd propose to have subsection to make things really crystal clear. -->
   <!-- <t>The benchmarking methodology of energy efficiency may enable intelligent
   decisions to optimize the energy consumption for individual devices
   and the network as a whole. Benchmarks are also required to compare
   the effectiveness of various energy optimization techniques.</t> -->
   
    <section title="Aim and Scope">

    <t>Benchmarking can be understood to serve two related but different objectives:<list>
	<t>Assessing ''which system performs best'' over a set of well-defined scenarios.</t>
        <t>Measuring the contribution of sub-systems to the overall system's performance
        (also known as ''micro-benchmark'').</t>
	 </list></t>

    <t>The benchmarking methodology outlined in this draft focuses on the first objective.
    Specifically, it aims to compare the energy efficiency for individual devices 
    (routers and switches belonging to similar device classes).
    The benchmark aims to showcase the effectiveness of various energy optimization 
    techniques for a given device and load type, with the objective of fostering
    improvements in the energy efficiency of future generations of devices.</t>

    <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
    "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14

    <section title="Total Weighted Capacity of the interfaces">	
     <t>The total weighted capacity of the interfaces (T) is the weighted sum of all interface throughputs.</t>
	 
     <t>Definition:<list>
				<t>T = B1*T1 +...+ Bi*Ti +...+ Bm*Tm</t>
	 </list></t>

     <t>Discussion:<list>
				<t>Ti is the total capacity of the interfaces for a fixed configuration model and traffic load
				(the sum of the interface bandwidths)</t>
				<t>Bi is the weighted multiplier for different traffic levels (note
                                that B1+...+Bj+...+Bm = 1, weight multipliers may be specified for router, switch differently,
				3 typical weighted multipliers are 0.1,0.8,0.1)</t>
				<t>m is the number of traffic load levels (if it is considered 100%, 30%, 0%; m = 3) Note that
				traffic load levels may be specified differently for router and switch, e.g., traffic level 
				100%,10%,0% for access router, traffic level 100%,30%,0% for core router and data center 
				switch.</t>
     </list></t>
    
	 <t>Measurement units:<list><t>Gbps.</t></list></t>

    <t>Issues<list>
      <t>The traffic loads and the weighted multipliers need to be clearly established a priori.</t>
      <t>It is unclear if the definition of the Ti's is/should be linked to the traffic load levels. 
      For a given port configuration (which may result in 50% of the total capacity a device can provide), 
      one may be interested in traffic load of e.g., 5% or 10% or the total capacity (not only 50%).</t>

    <section title="Total Weighted Power">	
     <t>The total weighted power (P) is the weighted sum of all power calculated for different traffic loads.</t>

				<t>P = B1*P1 +...+ Bi*Pi +...+ Bm*Pm</t>
	 </list></t>

     <t>Discussion:<list>
				<t>Pi is the Power of the equipment in each traffic load level (e.g. 100%, 30%, 0%)</t>
				<t>Bi is the weighted multiplier for different traffic levels (note that B1+...+Bj+...+Bm = 1)</t>

    <t>Issues:<list>
      <t>The traffic loads and the weighted multipliers need to be clearly established a priori.</t>
      <t>Importantly, the traffic must be forwarded of the correct port! 
      It would be easy to cut power down by dropping all traffic, and we of course do not want that.

      A tolerance on packet loss and/or forwarding error must be specified somehow.  That tolerance could
      be zero for some benchmark problems (e.g., Non packet loss (NDR) estimation), and non-zero for others.
      Tolerating some errors may be interesting to navigate the design space of energy saving techniques,
      such as approximate computing/routing. According to measurement procedure in section 6.5 of 
      [ATIS-0600015.03.2013], the Equipment Unit Test (EUT) should be able to return to full NDR load. 
      Failure to do so disqualifies the test results. </t>

    <section title="Energy Efficiency Ratio">	
     <t>Energy Efficiency Ratio (EER) is defined as the throughput forwarded by 1 watt
	 and it is introduced in <xref target="ETSI-ES-203-136" />. A higher EER corresponds

	 <t>Definition:<list>

    <section title="Energy Consumption Benchmarking">
	
   <t>The maximum power drawn by a device does not accurately 
   reflect the power under a normal workload.
   Indeed, the energy consumption of a networking device depends on its 
   configuration, connected transceivers, and traffic load. 
   Relying merely on the maximum rated power can overestimate the total
   energy of the networking devices.</t>

   <t>A network device consists of many components, each of which
   draws power (for example, it is possible to mention the power
   consumption of the CPU, data forwarding ASIC, memory, fan, etc.).
   Therefore, it is important to formulate a consistent benchmarking
   method for network devices and consider the workload variation 
   and test conditions.</t>

   <t>Enforcing controlled conditions on test conditions (e.g.,
   Temperature) is important for test procedure to make sure test conditions
   repeatable [RFC6985]. The measurement condition reported in [ATIS-0600015.2009] 
   and [ITUT-L.1310] should be applied, e.g., the power measurements shall be 
   performed in a laboratory environment under specific range of temperature, 
   humidity and atmosphere pressure.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Test Methodology">	  
	
     <section title="Test Setup">	 	
   <t>The test setup in general is compliant with <xref target="RFC2544" />.
   The Device Under Test (DUT) is connected to a Tester and a Power Meter.
   The Power Meter allows to measure the energy consumption of the device and
   can be used to measure power under various configurations and conditions.
   Tests SHOULD be done with bidirectional traffic that better reflects the real environment.
   The Tester is also a traffic generator that enables changing traffic conditions.    
   It is OPTIONAL to choose a non-equal proportion for upstream and downstream traffic.</t>

   <t>It is worth mentioning that the DUT also dissipates significant heat.
   That means that part of the power is used for actual work while the rest
   is dissipated as heat. This heating can lead to more power drawn
   by fans/ compressor for cooling the devices. The benchmarking methodology
   does not measure the power drawn by external cooling infrastructure.
   The Power Meter only measures the internal energy consumption of the device.</t>
   <!-- Romain: I think one way or another, temperature information must be known (if not controllled).
   IMO, both a device's heat production and its capacity of evacuating that heat are important for energy efficiency.
   Thus, if we are to compare devices' efficiency, it's useful to know whether heat management plays a role in 
   the observed differences in efficiency. I am not sure how to do this best yet, but I don't think we should 
   just say measuring this is optional. I would just comment the following sentence out for now. -->
   <!-- It is OPTIONAL to measure the device's temperature change, which
   can be correlated to the amount of external power drawn to cool the device.</t> -->
     </section>  
	 
    <section title="Traffic and Device Characterization">

    <!-- Romain: The dynamic power is too small today to emphasize it as an "important" factor IMO. I'd simply remove "important" -->
    <!-- <t>An important factor that impacts energy consumption is the 
    offered traffic load. Therefore, power measurements must be performed
    with different traffic loads to the network device.</t> -->
    <t>The traffic load supported by a device affects its energy consumption.
    Therefore, the benchmark MUST include different traffic loads.</t>

    <t>There are different interface types on a network device and the power usage 
    also depends on the kind of connector/transceiver used. 
    The interface type used needs to be specified as well.</t>
    
    <t>In addition, it is necessary to indicate the number of ports used per linecard 
    as well as the aggregate bandwidth that each linecard can accommodate.</t>
    
    <!-- Romain: No need to risk wrong statement here. Everything may affect power. -->
    <!-- <t>The traffic load also needs to be specified because different packet sizes 
    may not affect energy consumption, but the inter-packet delay may affect it.</t> -->
    <t>The traffic load must specify traffic type, packet size mixtures, percentage of
   overall traffic for each traffic type (See Annex D of [ATIS-0600015.2009] for
   more details), as all may affect the energy consumption of network devices. </t>
