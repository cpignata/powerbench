    <abstract>

   <t>This document defines a standard mechanism to measure, report, and
   compare power usage of different networking devices and under different
   network configurations and conditions.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
	
   <t>Energy efficiency is becoming increasingly important in the operation
   of network infrastructure. Network devices are typically always on, but
   in some cases, they run at very low average utilization rates. Both network
   utilization and energy consumption of these devices can be improved, 
   and that starts with a normalized characterization <xref target="RFC7460" />.

   The benchmarking methodology defined here will help operators to get
   a more accurate idea of the power drawn by their network and 
   will also help vendors to test the energy efficiency of their devices
   <xref target="RFC6988"/>.</t>

   <t>There is no standard mechanism to benchmark the power utilization 
   of networking devices like routers or switches. 
   <xref target="I-D.manral-bmwg-power-usage" /> started to analyze the issue.
   This document defines the mechanism to correctly characterize and benchmark 
   the energy consumption of networking devices to better 
   estimate and compare their power usage.</t>

   <!-- Romain: Well, not really, if we put the focus on "Assessing "who performs best" over 
   a set of well-defined scenario" as discussed. 
   I'd propose to have subsection to make things really crystal clear. -->
   <!-- <t>The benchmarking methodology of energy efficiency may enable intelligent
   decisions to optimize the energy consumption for individual devices
   and the network as a whole. Benchmarks are also required to compare
   the effectiveness of various energy optimization techniques.</t> -->
   
    <section title="Aim and Scope">

    <t>Benchmarking can be understood to serve two related but different objectives:<list>
	<t>Assessing ''which system performs best'' over a set of well-defined scenarios.</t>
        <t>Measuring the contribution of sub-systems to the overall system's performance
        (also known as ''micro-benchmark'').</t>
	 </list></t>

    <t>
    Achieving either objectives requires a well-defined set of principles prescribing
    what must be measured, how, and how to report the results. 
    Providing those principles is the objective of this draft.
    These are simply called "the benchmark" in the rest of this draft.</t>
    <!-- The benchmarking methodology outlined in this draft focuses on the first objective. -->
    <t>
    The benchmark aims to compare the energy efficiency for individual devices 
    (routers and switches belonging to similar device classes).
    In addition, it aims to showcase the effectiveness of various energy optimization 
    techniques for a given device and load type, with the objective of fostering
    improvements in the energy efficiency of future generations of devices.</t>
     </section>
  
     <section title="Replicability and Comparability">

     <t>Replicability is defined as achieving the same results with newly collected data.
     Formally, it is a pre-requisite for benchmarking. Benchmark results are meant to
     be compared, and this comparison is not sound is the individual results are not replicable.</t>

     <t>As discussed later in this draft, replicability in power measurements is complex
     as power is affected by a wide range of parameters, some of which are hard to control 
     e.g., the room temperature. Scrit</t>

     <t>Striving for "perfect" replicability would lead to prescribe extremely precisely 
     all the power-impacting factors in the test setup. We argue that this is unrealistic 
     and counter-productive. An overly presciptive benchmark becomes more complicated to 
     perform. Furthermore, results would then be comparable only accross benchmark results
     obtained under the exact same test conditions, which becomes increasingly less likely
     as we prescribe more and more.</t>

     <t>Instead, the benchmark described in this draft proposes to report on a number of
     power-impacting factors, but does not enforce specific values or settings for those.
     The aim is to make the benchmark easier to perform. The comparison between benchmark
     results may be somewhat less accurate or fair than with a more prescriptive benchmark, 
     but the hope is to have many more comparison points available, which would ultimately 
     provide a more robust image of the devices power demands and their evolution over time.</t>

     <t>In short: this draft argues it is better to have many benchmark results with 
     a higher uncertainty than a few very precise but hardly comparable ones.</t>

    <section anchor="terms" title="Terminology">

    <t>TODO (Romain): I am not convinced we want to keep those weighted metrics at all. Not deleting for now. Creating a new "total power" section instead.</t>

    <section title="Total Weighted Capacity of the interfaces">	
     <t>The total weighted capacity of the interfaces (T) is the weighted sum of all interface throughputs.</t>
	 
     <t>Definition:<list>
				<t>T = B1*T1 +...+ Bi*Ti +...+ Bm*Tm</t>
	 </list></t>

     <t>Discussion:<list>
				<t>Ti is the total capacity of the interfaces for a fixed configuration model and traffic load
				(the sum of the interface bandwidths)</t>
				<t>Bi is the weighted multiplier for different traffic levels (note
                                that B1+...+Bj+...+Bm = 1, weight multipliers may be specified for router, switch differently,
				3 typical weighted multipliers are 0.1,0.8,0.1)</t>
				<t>m is the number of traffic load levels (if it is considered 100%, 30%, 0%; m = 3) Note that
				traffic load levels may be specified differently for router and switch, e.g., traffic level 
				100%,10%,0% for access router, traffic level 100%,30%,0% for core router and data center 
				switch.</t>
     </list></t>
    
	 <t>Measurement units:<list><t>Gbps.</t></list></t>

    <t>Issues<list>
      <t>The traffic loads and the weighted multipliers need to be clearly established a priori.</t>
      <t>It is unclear if the definition of the Ti's is/should be linked to the traffic load levels. 
      For a given port configuration (which may result in 50% of the total capacity a device can provide), 
      one may be interested in traffic load of e.g., 5% or 10% or the total capacity (not only 50%).</t>

    <section title="Total Weighted Power">	
     <t>The total weighted power (P) is the weighted sum of all power calculated for different traffic loads.</t>
	 
	 <t>Definition:<list>
				<t>P = B1*P1 +...+ Bi*Pi +...+ Bm*Pm</t>

    <t>Issues:<list>
      <t>The traffic loads and the weighted multipliers need to be clearly established a priori.</t>
      <t>Importantly, the traffic must be forwarded of the correct port! 
      It would be easy to cut power down by dropping all traffic, and, naturally, we do not want that.

      A tolerance on packet loss and/or forwarding error must be specified somehow.  That tolerance could
      be zero for some benchmark problems (e.g., Non packet loss (NDR) estimation), and non-zero for others.
      Tolerating some errors may be interesting to navigate the design space of energy saving techniques,
      such as approximate computing/routing. According to measurement procedure in section 6.5 of 
      [ATIS-0600015.03.2013], the Equipment Unit Test (EUT) should be able to return to full NDR load. 
      Failure to do so disqualifies the test results. </t>

    <t>Issues:<list>
      <t>The total power depends on many different factors, including the running configuration,
      the number and type of transceiver connected, the forward traffic volume and pattern, 
      the version of the operating system, the room temperature and humidity/other environmental 
      dimensions, the aging of parts, etc. This metric does not allow to compare two equipements against 
      each over, but it may be enough to assess the effect of a change on the same equipment; e.g.,
      for optimizing the power draw by changing the running configuration.</t>
      <t>Importantly, the traffic must be forwarded of the correct port! 
      It would be easy to cut power down by dropping all traffic, and we of course do not want that.

    <section title="Energy Consumption Benchmarking">
	
   <t>The maximum power drawn by a device does not accurately 
   reflect the power under a normal workload.
   Indeed, the energy consumption of a networking device depends on its 
   configuration, connected transceivers, and traffic load. 
   Relying merely on the maximum rated power can overestimate the total
   energy of the networking devices.</t>

   <t>A network device consists of many components, each of which
   draws power (for example, it is possible to mention the power
   draw of the CPU, data forwarding ASIC, memory, fan, etc.).
   Therefore, it is important to formulate a consistent benchmarking
   method for network devices and consider the workload variation 
   and test conditions.</t>

   <t>Enforcing controlled conditions on test conditions (e.g.,
   Temperature) is important for test procedure to make sure test conditions
   repeatable <xref target="RFC6985" />. The measurement condition reported in [ATIS-0600015.2009] 
   and [ITUT-L.1310] should be applied, e.g., the power measurements shall be 
   performed in a laboratory environment under specific range of temperature, 
   humidity and atmosphere pressure.</t>

    <section title="Test Methodology">	  
	
     <section title="Test Setup">	 	
   <t>The test setup in general is compliant with <xref target="RFC2544" />.
   The Device Under Test (DUT) is connected to a Tester and a Power Meter.
   The Power Meter allows to measure the energy consumption of the device and
   can be used to measure power under various configurations and conditions.
   <!-- Old version (delete?) Tests SHOULD be done with bidirectional traffic that better reflects the real environment. -->
   Tests SHOULD (MUST?) be done by running one or several of the predefined traffic traces, 
   which are crafted to test different power hungry tasks related to packet processing.
   The Tester is also a traffic generator that enables changing traffic conditions.    
   It is OPTIONAL to choose a non-equal proportion for upstream and downstream traffic.</t>

   <t>It is worth mentioning that the DUT also dissipates significant heat.
   That means that part of the power is used for actual work while the rest
   is dissipated as heat. This heating can lead to more power drawn
   by fans/ compressor for cooling the devices. The benchmarking methodology
   does not measure the power drawn by external cooling infrastructure.
   The Power Meter only measures the internal energy consumption of the device.</t>
   <!-- Romain: I think one way or another, temperature information must be known (if not controllled).
   IMO, both a device's heat production and its capacity of evacuating that heat are important for energy efficiency.
   Thus, if we are to compare devices' efficiency, it's useful to know whether heat management plays a role in 
   the observed differences in efficiency. I am not sure how to do this best yet, but I don't think we should 
   just say measuring this is optional. I would just comment the following sentence out for now. -->

    <section title="Traffic and Device Characterization">

    <t>The traffic load supported by a device affects its energy consumption.
    Therefore, the benchmark MUST include different traffic loads.</t>
    
    <t>The traffic load must specify packet sizes, packet rates, and inter-packet 
    delays, as all may affect the energy consumption of network devices. To enable 
    replicable and comparable results, the benchmark specifies a set of traffic traces
    that MUST be used. Those traces are described below and made available "ready to use".</t>

    <t>TODO: Describe the benchmark traffic traces here.</t>

    <t>There are different interface types on a network device and the power usage 
    also depends on the kind of connector/transceiver used.
